<h3>Dis a poem </h3>
<p>In the woods—there lurks a beast, a feline bigger than you've ever seen. <br>
With magic in his veins, and teeth as sharp as steel, watch out for him in the night—or you might be his next meal. <br>
Possessing the mightiness of god, the last person to not worship his holiness had his face gnawed off. <br>
As the season changes to another the colours on his coat rearranges to a colour like no other. <br>
A mischievous creature, your food he will eat when you see him consider giving him a little treat. <br>
In reality innocent and as dangerous as a housecat but still beware, you'll never know where he's lurking—he might attack. <br>
